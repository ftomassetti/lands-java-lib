lands-java-lib
==============

Library to load objects produced by the python [lands](https://github.com/ftomassetti/lands) project (a world generator).

This is needed to integrate [lands](https://github.com/ftomassetti/lands) with Java/Clojure libraries.

The plan is to reuse Java libraries for erosion, like [procedurality-lands](https://github.com/ftomassetti/procedurality-lands) and develop AI for Civs simulation in Clojure (possibly using core.logic).
